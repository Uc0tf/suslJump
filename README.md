## School Programming Competition: Game

### **My project for the school game development competition in WinForms during my third year of high school.**

## About project:
- A 2D endless jumper game made in C# WinForms.
- Net5.0 framework used for this project.
- The game code is not well optimized due to the limited time available for the project and my insufficient knowledge at the time.
